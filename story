Once upon a time, there was a Proud Lion and a mighty rat. 
The lion upon seeing the rat, commented that he is too small and good-for-nothing.
The Rat got upset and walked away.
On another bright day, a hunter came to the forest and tricked the Lion into his net and caught him.
The Lion started crying for help and it was the mighty little rat who came for his help and bit away the hunter's net.
